# buildah_dockerfiles
This is a public repository of my custom Dockerfiles.

## How to use

Each folders have their own Dockerfiles. The folder name format is as follow, [CONTAINER_BASE]-[CONTAINER_APP]. Follow the README guide on each folders.

These guides uses podman and buildah in building and creating containers, but I'm pretty sure that these Dockerfiles can be used using docker itself.

## Troubleshooting

One of the most possible issue that you would encounter in using these guides are the containers are not reachable from the Internet. It might because of your firewall rules. I haven't really included firewall configuration on these guides, since firewall is for weak-hearted engineers lol

## Questions?

If you have questions on these Dockerfiles, just send me a message on my discord, ZeroExistence#8691.
